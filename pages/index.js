            Introduction
          </h2>
          <p id="ecf8799c-f517-4e1a-a3ae-ff9f010ca75b" className="">
            Hello, my name is Alex Merced, former Vice-Chair of the Libertarian
            National Committee. In seeing recent divisions among activists of
            all walks of libertarian life who I call family I am creating an
            effort to create a collaborative space to create new bridges and
            rebuild old ones, this is the Be Better caucus.
          </p>
          <p id="ece28565-2998-4300-b377-23d621c3a034" className="">
            This is not a traditional caucus trying to formally organize to take
            control or influence the Libertarian Party. Instead our aim, is to
            create a framework and brand, that’ll allow the existence of more
            narrowly scoped spaces for activism around the Libertarian Party
            that those directly and indirectly involved can collaborate on
            common cause.
          </p>
          <p id="eefe1fed-cd43-48e5-a047-dbeccd033e52" className="">
            We aren’t here to promote a type of libertarianism or any school of
            thought, just to bring people who think the world can be more free
            together to work outside of the esoteric inside-baseball that often
            divides but doesn’t play a huge role in the actual actions needed to
            create change.
          </p>
          <p id="1b321471-d4a9-420c-8269-65307b70fe71" className="">
            So my role is only to create this framework, build an inclusive
            accessible brand and help coordinate as there will be no top down
            power structure, just a framework for people to create scoped
            project based sub-groups that operate autonomously formally or
            informally as they want. The goal being that when a group acts using
            the BBC brand that what activism under that brand covers and doesn’t
            cover is clear and not try to be answer to every issue everywhere.

            Principles

            Activism through the Be Better Caucus is built around the following
            principles. This does not cover all issues and concerns, anything
            outside of this is not in the scope of this caucus, feel free to
            take that part of your activism elsewhere.

            This caucus is not the place for activism around divisive issues
            such as life/choice and questions of whether cultural practices
            should be conservative or progressive. Those debates can be held
            elsewhere, our focus is solely on the bullets above. We encourage
            you to work in Be Better spaces where you align with the principles
            above and use other spaces where the above isn’t covered or in
            conflict with your opinions.
