## Introduction

Hello, my name is Alex Merced, former Vice-Chair of the Libertarian National Committee. In seeing recent divisions among activists of all walks of libertarian life who I call family I am creating an effort to create a collaborative space to create new bridges and rebuild old ones, this is the Be Better caucus.

This is not a traditional caucus trying to formally organize to take control or influence the Libertarian Party. Instead our aim, is to create a framework and brand, that’ll allow the existence of more narrowly scoped spaces for activism around the Libertarian Party that those directly and indirectly involved can collaborate on common cause.

We aren’t here to promote a type of libertarianism or any school of thought, just to bring people who think the world can be more free together to work outside of the esoteric inside-baseball that often divides but doesn’t play a huge role in the actual actions needed to create change.

So my role is only to create this framework, build an inclusive accessible brand and help coordinate as there will be no top down power structure, just a framework for people to create scoped project based sub-groups that operate autonomously formally or informally as they want. The goal being that when a group acts using the BBC brand that what activism under that brand covers and doesn’t cover is clear and not try to be answer to every issue everywhere.

## Principles

Activism through the Be Better Caucus is built around the following principles. This does not cover all issues and concerns, anything outside of this is not in the scope of this caucus, feel free to take that part of your activism elsewhere.

- Promoting consent in the movement of goods, services, capital and people. (Free Exchange & Anti-prohibition)
- Encouraging a culture that enables respect for individual consent and coexistence by encouraging individuals to CHOOSE to embrace compassion, tolerance, kindness and forgiveness and individualism (Live and let live)
- Helping organize consent/community based solutions to to modern challenges (volunteering/fundraising for local shelters, soup kitchens, educational programs, etc.)
- Organizing to support Libertarian Party candidates who can credibly move the caucus principles forward. (You don’t have to be an LP member to be involved in BBC)

This caucus is not the place for activism around divisive issues such as life/choice and questions of whether cultural practices should be conservative or progressive. Those debates can be held elsewhere, our focus is solely on the bullets above. We encourage you to work in Be Better spaces where you align with the principles above and use other spaces where the above isn’t covered or in conflict with your opinions.

## What we are and what we aren’t

**What we are**

- A clearing house for sub-group to organize activism around particular issues, locations or candidacies
- A brand that people can organize under without worrying about their personal disagreements outside that narrowly scoped sub-group. Long as your ok with the broad principles stated above, your good.
- Helping be a beacon to organize for on the ground direct activism
- An effort to bring spaces for collaboration that couldn’t happen in more broadly defined spaces where broad disagreements can more easily block collaboration.

**What we aren’t**

- Organizing to take control of the party
- Trying to promote a “correct” kind of libertarianism
- A place to adjudicate political battles that occur within the libertarian movement and libertarian party.
- Trying displace or fill the role that other caucuses may play
- A place to debate the issues of the day outside the specific missions of the sun-groups you get active with.
- Looking to fundraise for the BBC itself (subgroups are autonomous and can act more formally if they’d like)

## How to get involved

Anyone can create a BBC subgroup to coordinate activism around the stated principles in a particular location, around a particular issue or a particular Libertarian Party candidate. You do not have to be a member of the Libertarian Party to collaborate in a subgroup.

BBC subgroups are just channels in the BBC slack workspace and should the name convention of “bbc-cause” here is a few examples:

- organizing in a particular county - “bbc-orange-county-fl”
- organizing for a particular issue - “bbc-drug-war”
- Organizing for a particular candidate - “bbc-larry-sharpe”

Once you create a group on the slack work space email email@bebettercaucus.com and I’ll add your group to the listing at bebettercaucus.com. 

## Slack Workspace Code of Conduct

The purpose of the BBC to foster on-topic spaces of courteous spaces for activism organization so communications on the slack workspace will be moderated and people removed if the rules aren’t followed. If you think you can’t follow the below rules this may not be the space for your activism.

- No off-topic disruptive discussions (conspiracy theories, debating other issues)
- No bigotry (if you got grief saying something at thanksgiving or in a public setting, don’t say it here)
- Respect others (no ad-hominem attacks, no misgendering participants that clearly stated a preferred pronoun, no assuming picking fights)

If a minor infraction warnings will be issue first before expulsion from the slack workspace. Please report any misconduct with links to the message and which subgroup channel to email@bebettercaucus.com
